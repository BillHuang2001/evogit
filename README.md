# EvoGit

Welcome to EvoGit: Decentralized Code Evolution via Git-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration

## Demo

We provide two demos to showcase the capabilities of EvoGit:

1. [EvoGit Task 1](https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit_web)
2. [EvoGit Task 2](https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit_llm)

Both demos are 100% written by AI, except for the initial setup.
The initial setup is performed by a human and placed in the `main` branch, while the AI-generated code is placed in the `host<i>-individual-<j>` branch for each node `i` and agent number `j`.

> [!NOTE]
> The GitHub UI may not display all branches by default. Click the `view all branches` link to see the complete list.
