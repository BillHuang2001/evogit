## Quick Start

Here are some examples to get you started with EvoX:

### Single-objective Optimization

Solve the Ackley problem using the PSO algorithm:

```python
import torch
from evox.algorithms import PSO
from evox.problems.numerical import Ackley
from evox.workflows import StdWorkflow, EvalMonitor

# torch.set_default_device("cuda") # Uncomment this line if you want to use GPU by default

algorithm = PSO(pop_size=100, lb=-32 * torch.ones(10), ub=32 * torch.ones(10))
problem = Ackley()
monitor = EvalMonitor()
workflow = StdWorkflow(algorithm, problem, monitor)
workflow.init_step()
for i in range(100):
    workflow.step()

monitor.plot() # or monitor.plot().show() if you are using headless mode
```

### Multi-objective Optimization

Solve the DTLZ2 problem using the RVEA algorithm:

```python
import torch
from evox.algorithms import RVEA
from evox.metrics import igd
from evox.problems.numerical import DTLZ2
from evox.workflows import StdWorkflow, EvalMonitor

# torch.set_default_device("cuda") # Uncomment this line if you want to use GPU by default

prob = DTLZ2(m=2)
pf = prob.pf()
algo = RVEA(
    pop_size=100,
    n_objs=2,
    lb=-torch.zeros(12),
    ub=torch.ones(12)
)
monitor = EvalMonitor()
workflow = StdWorkflow(algo, prob, monitor)
workflow.init_step()
for i in range(100):
    workflow.step()

monitor.plot() # or monitor.plot().show() if you are using headless mode
```

### Neuroevolution

Evolving a simple MLP model to solve the Brax HalfCheetah environment:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from evox.algorithms import PSO
from evox.problems.neuroevolution.brax import BraxProblem
from evox.utils import ParamsAndVector
from evox.workflows import EvalMonitor, StdWorkflow

# torch.set_default_device("cuda") # Uncomment this line if you want to use GPU by default

class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # observation space is 17-dim, action space is 6-dim.
        self.features = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(17, 8), nn.Tanh(), nn.Linear(8, 6))

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.tanh(self.features(x))

# Initialize the MLP model
model = SimpleMLP()
adapter = ParamsAndVector(dummy_model=model)
# Set the population size
POP_SIZE = 1024
# Get the bound of the PSO algorithm
model_params = dict(model.named_parameters())
pop_center = adapter.to_vector(model_params)
lb = torch.full_like(pop_center, -5)
ub = torch.full_like(pop_center, 5)
# Initialize the PSO, and you can also use any other algorithms
algorithm = PSO(pop_size=POP_SIZE, lb=lb, ub=ub)
# Initialize the Brax problem
problem = BraxProblem(
    policy=model,
    env_name="halfcheetah",
    max_episode_length=1000,
    num_episodes=3,
    pop_size=POP_SIZE,
)
# set an monitor, and it can record the top 3 best fitnesses
monitor = EvalMonitor(topk=3)
# Initiate an workflow
workflow = StdWorkflow(
    algorithm=algorithm,
    problem=problem,
    monitor=monitor,
    opt_direction="max",
    solution_transform=adapter,
)
workflow.init_step()
for i in range(50):
    workflow.step()

monitor.plot() # or monitor.plot().show() if you are using headless mode
```
